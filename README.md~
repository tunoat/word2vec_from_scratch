# word2vec_from_scratch
READING PAPER iS HARD?
It is very confusing to go through all equation to understand it, differentiate it and coding from it?

Take it easy.

This is only the basic implementation.
Only lib from anaconda would be enough to run this.

I am practically new to python, machine learning and NLP field but I find it very interesting.
The problem so far when I started studying this is that, I cannot find an example that provide the "KNOW HOW" to implement the idea all over the internet step-by-step
The basic concept and idea is what i gather from a various place then mix and conclude them together(also made some correction).
You could find a better explanation in the following link which I found very useful.

For everyone who still quite new to machine learning with neural network and NLP, please following the link provide below.
I guarantee no paper need to be read and you could start understand this without spending countless hours to understand everything from scratch.

Concrete idea from google.

More explanation from Krishan which I found very useful.
